# shell-gen

shell-gen (`sg`) is a command-line utility for generating shell commands from natural language prompts, powered by GPT-4.

## Usage

The generator expects the environment variable $OPENAI_API_KEY to be set to an OpenAI API key. Visit https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys to obtain one and make sure there is credit on your account.

`sg <prompt>`

The generator will print the command that's about to be executed to the terminal. If you do not wish to run it, simply exit the program with ⌘+C (or Ctrl+C on Windows), otherwise, pressing enter will execute the command.

## Examples

```
$ sg "create two files, 'names_en' and 'names_fr'. The files should contain 5 English and 5 French names respectively"
echo -e "John\nJames\nElizabeth\nSophia\nEdward" > names_en && echo -e "Jean\nMarie\nFrançois\nClaire\nPhilippe" > names_fr
```

```
$ sg "print the contents of names_fr"      
cat names_fr

Jean
Marie
François
Claire
Philippe
```

```
g "create a tarball called 'names.tar' containing names_en and names_fr"
tar -czvf names.tar names_en names_fr
a names_en
a names_fr
```

## Disclaimer

Use this tool at your own risk. You should never execute *any* command that you do not fully understand. Copy-pasting shell commands from the web is asking for trouble and likewise there is no guarantee that the commands generated by this utility are safe. Plugging an AI directly into a shell without any thought is how we end up with Skynet. You have been warned.
